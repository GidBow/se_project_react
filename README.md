# React + Vite

This project is called WTWR, a weather app that helps you pick what to wear.

The main page shows the date and temperature of your current area and displays clothing option that corrilate to that weather. There is a toggle button to switch between Fahrenheit and Celcius so it is versitile. When you click on profile name or image you will be sent to a page to see your profile information and shown all the clothing items saved. Above that you will see a button to add your own images for clothing items which can also be found on the main page. When clicking an item a pop-up will apear with more details on the item and the option to delete, but don't worry there is a confimation pop-up making sure this is an intentional choice.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. A preloaded database with options to delete or add for customization.
